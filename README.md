# Catkeys
I developed this client because I couldn't find any Misskey client app that met my preferences. It's still in very early development and therefore I would recommend not to use it before a real version comes out :<

You can also find this app on the play store! [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.catpawz.catkeys) 

!!THE PLAY STORE LINK IS CURRENTLY NOT WORKING DUE TO SOME ISSUES WITH GOOGLE PLAY REQUIREMENTS!!
!!I am not gonna work on this a lot anymore due to some other events in my life, i'm planning to completely redo this though!!
